# Stepwise

Stepwise is a Swift framework for executing a series of steps asynchronously. Steps are single-dependency and cancelable. `Step` objects wrap your closures; they're genericized so you get strongly-typed inputs and outputs. Here's a totally contrived example of steps to fetch an image from the Internet and shrink it by half:

```swift
let fetchAndResizeImageSteps = toStep { (step: Step<NSURL, UIImage>) in
    // This is the url we pass into the step chain
    let url = step.input
    
    // Fetch the image data. Obviously we'd be using Alamofire or something irl.
    if let imageData = NSData(contentsOfURL: url) {
        // Create the image
        let image = UIImage(data: imageData)!
        
        // Pass it to the next step
        step.resolve(image)
    }
    else {
        // Oh no! Something went wrong!
        step.error(NSError(domain: "com.my.domain", code: -1, userInfo: nil))
    }
}.then { (step: Step<UIImage, UIImage>) in
    // Grab the fetched image
    let image = step.input
    
    // Resize it
    let targetSize = CGSize(width: image.size.width / 2.0, height: image.size.height / 2.0)
    UIGraphicsBeginImageContextWithOptions(targetSize, true, 0.0)
    image.drawInRect(CGRect(origin: CGPoint(x: 0, y: 0), size: targetSize))
    let resizedImage = UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext()
    UIGraphicsEndImageContext()
    
    // Return it
    step.resolve(resizedImage)
}.then { (step: Step<UIImage, Void>) in
    // Get fetched, resized image
    let image = step.input
    
    // Do something with image here.
    // Set it to a shared variable, pass it to another step, etc.
    step.resolve()
}

// Having set up the chain of steps, pass in a URL to get fetching.
let importantImageURL = NSURL(string: "http://i1.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/000/774/lime-cat.jpg")!
fetchAndResizeImageSteps.start(importantImageURL)
```

The first step, created by the `toStep` function, accepts a closure with a single step parameter. The step parameter is of type `Step<NSURL, UIImage>`, so it accepts an `NSURL` as input and outputs a `UIImage` if successful. The first step fetches the data from the URL and tries to create an image from it. If it fails the step results in an error and calls `step.error()`. If all is well the step resolves by calling `step.resolve(image)`.

When a step resolves successfully it passes its output as input to the next step, which is created by calling `then()`. In this example the second step resizes the image to half-size, then resolves with it. There is no error case.

The third step, also enqueued with `then()`, is just an example of a step with a `Void` output. Steps with `Void` outputs may call `resolve()` without an argument, just as steps with `Void` inputs may call `start()` without an argument.

### Errors

In the example above there is no error handler for the `error()` in the first step, but a handler can be added at any point in the chain by calling `onError()`. `onError()` accepts a simple closure with an `NSError` parameter and allows your code to react to errors generated by steps. Here's a quick example:

```swift
// prints "ERROR: Error in step 1!"
toStep { (step: Step<Void, String>) in
    step.error(NSError(domain: "com.my.domain", code: -1, userInfo: [NSLocalizedDescriptionKey : "Error in step 1!"]))
}.then { (step : Step<String, Int>) in
    // This never executes.
    println("I never execute!")
    step.resolve(countElements(step.input))
}.onError { error in
    println("ERROR: \(error.localizedDescription)")
}.start()
```

An important limitation to note is that, at present, a chain of steps can only have a single error handler. You can multiplex responses to errors in the handler by erroring with different domains, codes, or userInfos per step.

### Cancellation

Cancellation is baked right into Stepwise. Every step chain has a `cancellationToken` property that returns a `CancellationToken` object. This object provides a single method, `cancel()`, which cancels any step that has this token. Every step in a chain will consult the token before and during execution to see if it has been canceled. Here's an example:

```swift
let willCancelStep = toStep { (step: Step<Void, String>) in
    // Will never execute.
    step.resolve("some result")
}

willCancelStep.start()

// Grab the step's token and cancel it.
let token = willCancelStep.cancellationToken
token.cancel(reason: "Canceling for a really good reason.")
```

You may optionally provide a `String` reason in the cancel method for logging purposes.

### Finally

Each chain also provides a `finally` method which you can call to attach a handler that will *always* execute when the chain ends, errors, or is canceled. A parameter of type `ChainState` is passed into the handler to indicate the result of the chain. Relying on `finally` to process the result of a chain is discouraged; instead, use another `then` step with a `Void` output type. `finally` is provided for must-occur situations regardless of error or cancel state, like closing file resources. Here's an example:

```swift
// In this extremely contrived example, assume we already have an open `NSOutputStream`
// that we must close after our steps complete, regardless of success or erroring out.
let outputStream : NSOutputStream = ...
let someDataURL : NSURL = ...

toStep { (step : Step<Void, NSData>) in
    if let someData = NSData(contentsOfURL: someDataURL) {
        step.resolve(someData)
    }
    else {
        step.error(NSError(domain: "com.my.domain.fetch-data", code: -1, userInfo: nil))
    }
}.then { (step: Step<NSData, Void>) in
    // Write our data
    let data = step.input
    var bytes = UnsafePointer<UInt8>(data.bytes)
    var bytesRemaining = data.length

    while bytesRemaining > 0 {
        let written = outputStream.write(bytes, maxLength: bytesRemaining)
        if written == -1 {
            step.error(NSError(domain: "com.my.domain.write-data", code: -1, userInfo: nil))
            return
        }

        bytesRemaining -= written
        bytes += written
    }

    step.resolve()
}.onError { error in
    // Handle error here...
}.finally { resultState in
    // Close the stream here
    outputStream.close()
}.start()
```
